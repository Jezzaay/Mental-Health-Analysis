# Mental Health Analysis

This was for my master's research project. Where I used Public Health England data (children & youth dataset along with suicide dataset) for the core part of the data.  Also including GDHI and house pricing dataset, focusing within 2017. I looked further towards London and the north east for the project, as London is the capital and I am based within the north east. The machine learning of regression is wrong I do know this and I understand where I went wrong. However, I am not changing this code as I am leaving it as I submitted it with my thesis. 

All work has been part of my Master's Project in 2019 for my Master's Data Science.
